abstract: Model-driven engineering (MDE) supports the engineering of complex systems
  via multiple models representing various systems’ aspects. These interrelated models
  are usually heterogeneous and often specified using complementary modeling languages.
  Whenever needed, model view solutions can be employed to federate these models in
  a more transparent way. To do so, the required inter-model links can sometimes be
  automatically computed via explicitly written matching rules. However, in some cases,
  matching rules would be too complex (or even impossible) to write. Thus, some inter-model
  links may be inferred by analyzing previous examples instead. In this paper, we
  introduce a Machine Learning (ML)backed approach for expressing and computing such
  model views. Notably, we aim at making the use of ML as simple as possible in this
  context. To this end, we propose to refine and extend the ViewPoint Definition Language
  (VPDL) from the EMF Views model view solution to integrate the use of dedicated
  Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs). These view-specific HGNNs can be trained
  with appropriate sets of contributing models before being used for inferring links
  to be added to the views.
