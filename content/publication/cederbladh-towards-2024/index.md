abstract: Designing modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is posing new challenges
  to both industrial practitioners and academics. In this context, adopting cutting-edge
  paradigms, such as Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), DevOps, and Artificial
  Intelligence (AI), can offer new opportunities for improving CPS design automation.
  While such paradigms are already jointly used in the research community to support
  system design activities, there is a need to fill the gap between academia and industrial
  practitioners. Indeed, system specification is still mainly performed manually in
  many industrial projects. In this paper, we present a collaboration between industrial
  and academic partners of the AIDOaRt European project towards a model-based approach
  for CPS engineering applied in one of the project use cases. We identify key challenges
  and corresponding solutions to enhance the automation of CPS design processes. Notably,
  we consider a combination of prescriptive modeling, model transformations, model
  views, modeling process mining, and AI-based modeling recommendations. As an initial
  evaluation, the proposed approach is applied to a practical industrial case study.
