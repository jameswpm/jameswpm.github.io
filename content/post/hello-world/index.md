This is the first post and its here just to test if everything is working fine.

Since I plan to keep the posts here aligned with what is expected for a "tech blog", nothing better for a test than running a "Hello, world!" program. So, I leave below the implementation of this program in some programming languages which I'm currently working with these days.

**Java Hello, world!**
```java
class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

**Python Hello, world!**
```python
print "Hello, world!"
```

**Clojure Hello, world!**
```clojure
(ns hello-world)

(defn hello []
  "Hello, World!")
```

That's it for now! See you!
