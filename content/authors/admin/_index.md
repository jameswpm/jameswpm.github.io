    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network‚Äôs architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the CEA-List (Saclay, France) where I work on LLM-based agents for software engineering. My current research interests include AI Engineering and the future of software engineering.

I received my PhD in Software engineering from IMT Atlantique (Nantes, France) in 2025 for my thesis titled "Federation of heterogeneous models with machine learning-assisted model views". I worked at the AIDOaRt European project, as a member of the NaoMod group in the Laboratory of digital sciences of Nantes (LS2N).
