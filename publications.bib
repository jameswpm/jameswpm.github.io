	abstract = {Model-driven engineering (MDE) supports the engineering of complex systems via multiple models representing various systems’ aspects. These interrelated models are usually heterogeneous and often specified using complementary modeling languages. Whenever needed, model view solutions can be employed to federate these models in a more transparent way. To do so, the required inter-model links can sometimes be automatically computed via explicitly written matching rules. However, in some cases, matching rules would be too complex (or even impossible) to write. Thus, some inter-model links may be inferred by analyzing previous examples instead. In this paper, we introduce a Machine Learning (ML)backed approach for expressing and computing such model views. Notably, we aim at making the use of ML as simple as possible in this context. To this end, we propose to refine and extend the ViewPoint Definition Language (VPDL) from the EMF Views model view solution to integrate the use of dedicated Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs). These view-specific HGNNs can be trained with appropriate sets of contributing models before being used for inferring links to be added to the views.},

	abstract = {Designing modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is posing new challenges to both industrial practitioners and academics. In this context, adopting cutting-edge paradigms, such as Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), DevOps, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), can offer new opportunities for improving CPS design automation. While such paradigms are already jointly used in the research community to support system design activities, there is a need to fill the gap between academia and industrial practitioners. Indeed, system specification is still mainly performed manually in many industrial projects. In this paper, we present a collaboration between industrial and academic partners of the AIDOaRt European project towards a model-based approach for CPS engineering applied in one of the project use cases. We identify key challenges and corresponding solutions to enhance the automation of CPS design processes. Notably, we consider a combination of prescriptive modeling, model transformations, model views, modeling process mining, and AI-based modeling recommendations. As an initial evaluation, the proposed approach is applied to a practical industrial case study.},
